Look-up for standard DS/ML methodologies

This is a repository for standard methods in data science/machine learning. I use the old faithful Titanic dataset which is available all around. Both NeuralNetwork and more standards classifiers are used and seem to give good results. For larger datasets more complicated bagging/boosting methods and other tricks would be more appropriated :)
